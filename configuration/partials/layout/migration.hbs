            Access to Funding Scotland is changing
          </h3>
          <p>
            Funding Scotland is run by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), the national membership organisation for the voluntary sector. This is one of our local funding websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of our users make use of the free search facility which will continue to be available to everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, from 6 April 2021, you will need to be an SCVO member or supporter to access saved searches, personalised email alerts, lists and notes.
          </p>
